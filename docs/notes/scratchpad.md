# Scratchpad

This is my running scratchpad for the AIAYN replication project.
Raw, unordered thoughts and notes go here first.
Later, Iâ€™ll distill them into daily logs (`day_XX.md`).

- **Tasks Completed:**
    - Got ROCm installed.
    - Installed JAX for ROCm.
    - Downloaded "Attention Is All You Need" paper and began reading.
- **Key Learnings/Insights:**
    - **Clarification: Sequence Transduction vs. Transductive Learning**
        - **Sequence Transduction:** Refers to transforming one sequence into another. In NLP, this means ingesting a sequence and autoregressively decoding a new sequence using both the original input and the generated output so far. Input/output lengths can differ.
        - **Transductive Learning:** Inference on specific known unlabeled instances during training (e.g., filling in missing labels in a known graph), as opposed to inductive learning which generalizes to unseen examples.
